According to the 2013 National School Climate Survey, fewer than five percent of LGBT students had health classes with positive representations of LGBTQA+-related topics. Things did not change over the years. According to the 2015 Millennials, Sexuality, and Reproductive Health Survey, only 12 percent said their sex education classes covered same-sex relationships. People who identified themselves as LGBTQA+, especially youth, have limited or even no access to sex education materials, whether in classrooms, from family members, or in their social circles. Many LGBTQA+ people donâ€™t feel comfortable talking about sex, sexual health, and sexual experiences with others. Therefore, we decided to build an website that provides LGBTQA+ inclusive sex education resources to help resolve this public health and social justice issue. Our website aims to fill this gap by helping the LGBTQA+ community to learn more about sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. Users will be able to use the website to test their level of knowledge of the subject matter, find relevant education information, customize calendars to track sexual activities, set reminders for taking pills or shots, and ask questions for medical options. While the primary target users are people who are part of the LGBTQA+ community, we are open to extending features to straight identifying allies.
